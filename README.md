## 🔊 Analog Signal Generator
This project is part of my portfolio of evidence in electronic engineering.

The Analog Signal Generator simulates the generation of three fundamental waveforms:

> ⬛ Square wave

> 🔺 Triangular wave

> 〰️ Sine wave

The circuit is designed using basic analog building blocks including the 555 Timer IC and operational amplifiers. Simulation was performed in Tinkercad.

## 📝 Overview
- A square wave is generated using an astable 555 timer.

- A potentiometer is included to allow variable frequency control (0–1kHz range).

- The square wave output is passed through a buffer and summer circuit to allow for DC offset adjustment.

- A final voltage follower buffers the adjusted square wave output for further use.

- A triangular wave is generated by passing the buffered square wave through an integrator circuit.

- The integrator uses a 100Ω resistor and 1MΩ feedback resistor, as detailed in the schematic.

- The triangular wave is buffered before further processing.

- A sine wave is generated by passing the buffered triangular wave through another integrator stage.

- This stage smooths the triangular waveform into a sinusoidal shape.

## ⚠️ Current Limitations and Planned Improvements
> 🔄 Modify 555 Timer circuit to allow variable duty cycle in addition to frequency control.

> ➕ Add an AC-coupling ceramic capacitor to the input of the triangular waveform integrator.

> 🛠️ Troubleshoot why the negative halves of the triangular and sine waves appear clipped.

> 🔍 Explore replacing the 555 timer with a relaxation oscillator using op-amps.

> ⚡ Address simulation slowdown issues when adjusting the frequency potentiometer.
  (Tip: Set the slider to an end before selecting the desired frequency.)

> 📈 Research higher-performance op-amps that would allow higher-frequency waveform generation.
